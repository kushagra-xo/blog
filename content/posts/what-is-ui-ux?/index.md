It's like you dressing up for the appropriate occasion. You dress differently for a wedding, for a party, for a beach, and for sleeping. Similarly we represent information according to the context. For a more formal website, you'd use more formal fonts, and monochromatic colors, but for a club's website, you may choose to get creative with how things look.
