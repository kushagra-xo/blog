PITX is a file format that I have envisioned to create in the coming months as a new way to store digital media, a way where images are stored with their context, with their story, i.e. text.

## Inspiration

Every image tells a story, yet so many of these stories are lost due to the lack of appropriate textual context. This gap inspired me to create PITX, a new file format designed to store images along with their stories, bringing us back to the exact moments we cherish.

## The Way Forward

I envision a future where galleries seamlessly integrate textual context with visual data, improving our interation. Adding and reading these stories should be as effortless as capturing the images themselves.

## Current Progress

I've already begun developing the basic structure and functionality of the PITX file type. You can follow the progress and contribute at [kushagra-xo/pitx](https://github.com/kushagra-xo/pitx).
