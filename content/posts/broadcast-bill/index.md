## Introduction

The [Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_Services_(Regulation)_Bill,_2023), 2023 is a proposed law, that aims
to alter the regulatory framework for broadcasting services in India, to establish control over a wider set of services and a regime of censorship. This bill inflicts
major concerns about press, privacy and creative freedom in the subcontinent.

## Proposal

### Consolidation
The bill primarily aims to bring all broadcasting services, such as the television, online news, including social media and OTT under a single belt of regularatory framework.

### Threat to Freedom

- **Content Regulation**: The bill proposes strong content regulation and a seperate commitee at their cost, to regulate and censor content on every service.

### Privacy Concerns
- **Data Collection and Storage**: The requirement for broadcasting network operators to maintain detailed *subscriber data*, including personal information, raises concerns about how this data is collected, stored, and used.
