## Why Use Instagram?

I feel that even though privacy is very important for me, with time i have noticed that you can utilize instagram in such a way that it does not violate your privacy rights and prove useful in certain cenarios.

### For The New Ones

Being on instagram allows you to have a way to connect with new people that you might exchange your instagram id's with. It is way more convinient to exhcnage instagram handles than trying to convince them to come to signal, which not many people really use.

### Keeping Up 

Instagram allows you to stay and keep in touch with friends that are not currently on privacy respecting platforms, those who you have met recently, and those who dont find it worth the effort, for whatever reason, and like things in one place. Which is something I have grown to respect. It also allows you stay up-to date with the trends that are currently ongoing. I really hate it when there is some conversation going on and i dont seem to get the references they make.

### To advocate

No one is stopping you to use instagram as a tool to spread more word about safeguarding digital privacy.

## How Can You Make It Bearable?

Along with using instagram, come a lot of problems. Such as issues regarding privacy, wasting your time while scrolling, and there are also some ethical concerns that some talk about.

### Privacy Settings

Instagram has split the settings regarding your account into two places as of the time of writing this post.

#### Generic Settings

- Profile Picture: Go to Settings > Edit Profile

Use a generic profile picture. Your profile picture is publicly available, and using your own photo makes you identifiable and shares it with Instagram.

- Private Account: Go to Settings > Account Privacy

Turn your account private to prevent making information public.

I suggest going through all of the settings to ensure everything is set up to your liking.

#### Accounts Center

- Disconnect Future Activity: Go to Account Settings > Your Information and Permissions > Your Activity Off Meta Technologies > Manage Future Activity

This will disconnect information that businesses and organizations send Meta about your interactions with them.

- Ad Preferences: Go to Accounts Settings > Ad Preferences > Manage Info > Activity Information from Ad Partners

Select “No, don’t make my ads more relevant by using this information” to use less of your information for making personalized ads.

### Enable E2EE (End-To-End-Encryption)

Instagram has supported end-to-end encryption (E2EE) in their chats for a while now, allowing for more private and secure conversations. The legitimacy and effectiveness of this feature will be discussed in a future post.

### Productivity Tips

To maximize your time on Instagram:
- Follow Valuable Accounts: Follow people and accounts that add value to your life.
- Avoid Mindless Scrolling: Be mindful of your usage to prevent wasting time.

By following these tips, you can use Instagram in a way that aligns with your privacy values and lifestyle.
