      <title>Why Do I Contribute to OpenStreetMap?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to share why I contribute to OpenStreetMap (OSM) and why you should care—or even consider joining in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-openstreetmap&#34;&gt;What is OpenStreetMap?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenStreetMap (OSM) is an open database of geographic data (geo-data) that anyone can contribute to. Unlike maps controlled by profit-driven corporations, OSM is a purely community-driven project. Its mission is to create a comprehensive and freely accessible log of all geographic data on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

<h2 id="what-is-openstreetmap">What is OpenStreetMap?</h2>
<p>OpenStreetMap (OSM) is an open database of geographic data (geo-data) that anyone can contribute to. Unlike maps controlled by profit-driven corporations, OSM is a purely community-driven project. Its mission is to create a comprehensive and freely accessible log of all geographic data on Earth.</p>
<p><img alt="Central London Map" loading="lazy" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Soho_-_map_1.png"></p>
<h2 id="why-should-you-care">Why Should You Care?</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Community Driven</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OSM is built by volunteers from all over the world, making it a shared resource owned by no single entity. This open model prevents corporate control over what data is added, modified, or prioritized.</li>
<li>Maps controlled by private companies often introduce issues like biased data inclusion and reduced privacy. OSM stands as a fair and equitable alternative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s a Database</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At its core, OSM is a database. This enables users to perform incredibly detailed and specialized tasks beyond what traditional maps offer. Whether it’s building navigation systems, analyzing urban infrastructure, or creating highly customized maps, OSM’s database unlocks limitless possibilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-i-contribute">Why I Contribute</h2>
<p>For me, OpenStreetMap feels like a miniature digital version of Earth. It’s a recreation of our world, and contributing to it excites me. I see it as a way to make this virtual Earth as complete and accurate as possible.</p>
<p>Here are more reasons why I love contributing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Granularity</strong>: OSM allows contributors to add incredibly minute details—things you’d never find on a corporate map. For instance, I’ve added over 50 shelters in Delhi to the map, which brings me a sense of pride and fulfillment. Beyond shelters, you can map basketball courts, football fields, gates, trees, and even park benches. The smallest contributions collectively make OSM an unparalleled resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Equitable Access</strong>: Earth belongs to all of us. By contributing to OSM, I’m helping ensure that geographic data remains freely accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or location. This open access empowers individuals and communities in ways commercial maps never could.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exploring Local Regions</strong>: Contributing to OSM motivates me to explore local areas that are often overlooked or underrepresented. Mapping these regions not only helps the database but also let&rsquo;s me get more involved in my locality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="join-the-movement">Join the Movement</h2>
<p>If you’ve ever felt frustrated by the limitations of traditional maps or simply want to make a difference, OSM is an incredible platform to explore. It’s not just about mapping—it’s about contributing to a global, community-driven project that benefits everyone.</p>
<p>Start small. Add a detail in your neighborhood, like a park or a missing road. Or go big and help map entire regions. Every contribution counts. Together, we can build the most complete and accessible geographic database to exist.</p>

      <title>Broadcasting Services Bill</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/broadcast-bill/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India is on the verge of introducing a change in its media architecture with the proposed &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_Services_(Regulation)_Bill,_2023&#34;&gt;Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, 2023&lt;/a&gt;. While the intention behind this bill seems noble—establishing control over a wider range of broadcasting services and implementing censorship—the implications are far-reaching and concerning for press freedom, privacy, and creative expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-consolidated-regulatory-framework&#34;&gt;A Consolidated Regulatory Framework&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed bill seeks to consolidate all broadcasting services, including digital platforms like social media, under a single regulatory framework. This move raises questions about the government&amp;rsquo;s intentions and potential control over what content is permitted in public discourse as we are well aware of the control established by the majority government in the past decade over journalistic independence and freedom. By expanding its reach to cover both traditional and digital mediums, the bill poses a significant threat to India&amp;rsquo;s digital journalism, which has played a crucial role in shaping public opinion and intellectual in the recent years, when the traditional forms of media were completely biased.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>India is on the verge of introducing a change in its media architecture with the proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_Services_(Regulation)_Bill,_2023">Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, 2023</a>. While the intention behind this bill seems noble—establishing control over a wider range of broadcasting services and implementing censorship—the implications are far-reaching and concerning for press freedom, privacy, and creative expression.</p>
<h2 id="a-consolidated-regulatory-framework">A Consolidated Regulatory Framework</h2>
<p>The proposed bill seeks to consolidate all broadcasting services, including digital platforms like social media, under a single regulatory framework. This move raises questions about the government&rsquo;s intentions and potential control over what content is permitted in public discourse as we are well aware of the control established by the majority government in the past decade over journalistic independence and freedom. By expanding its reach to cover both traditional and digital mediums, the bill poses a significant threat to India&rsquo;s digital journalism, which has played a crucial role in shaping public opinion and intellectual in the recent years, when the traditional forms of media were completely biased.</p>
<h2 id="threats-to-press-freedom">Threats to Press Freedom</h2>
<p>The bill proposes strong content regulation through a separate committee responsible for regulating and censoring content on every service. This move raises concerns about the government&rsquo;s control over what can be reported and how journalists are expected to conduct themselves when sharing news or opinions. Additionally, the requirement for individual journalists and creators to register and follow broadcasting rules when commenting on news is troubling, as it could lead to self-censorship and stifle independent voices.</p>
<h2 id="the-dominance-of-government">The Dominance of Government</h2>
<p>The broadcasting advisory council in the proposed bill is dominated by government bureaucrats rather than independent voices. This move raises concerns about the potential for political influence over media content and the erosion of journalistic integrity. It also implies that the government will have a substantial role in shaping public discourse, which could lead to a suppression of dissenting views, highlights of which have very well been seen.</p>
<h2 id="privacy-concerns">Privacy Concerns</h2>
<p>The requirement for broadcasting network operators to maintain detailed subscriber data, including personal information, raises privacy concerns. This move can potentially expose individuals&rsquo; private information to unauthorized parties and create vulnerabilities for identity theft or surveillance. Furthermore, the collection and storage of such sensitive data could infringe upon citizens&rsquo; rights to privacy.</p>
<h2 id="call-to-action">Call to action</h2>
<p>As this proposed bill gains momentum in India&rsquo;s legislative process, it is essential that citizens, journalists, and media professionals take a stand against its potential dangers. Here are some steps you can take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact your local representatives and express your concerns about the bill.</li>
<li>Share your thoughts on social media using relevant hashtags such as #KillTheBill to raise awareness.</li>
<li>Support organizations and individuals who are fighting against the bill such as IFF (Indian Freedom Foundation).</li>

      <title>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/virtual-private-networks/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Nov 2023 17:12:44 +0530</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Virtual Private Networks act as an important tool in the modern digital landscape empowering many to protect their privacy, and circumvent government imposed censorship. What the people need is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The ability to choose what we wish to share and what we wish to access, and a VPN puts that power in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk some tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-vpn&#34;&gt;What is a VPN?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A virtual private network (VPN) is a mechanism for creating a secure
connection between a computing device and a computer network, or
between two networks, using an insecure communication medium such as the
public Internet
&amp;ndash; &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Virtual Private Networks act as an important tool in the modern digital landscape empowering many to protect their privacy, and circumvent government imposed censorship. What the people need is <em><strong>choice</strong></em>. The ability to choose what we wish to share and what we wish to access, and a VPN puts that power in your hands.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk some tech.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-vpn">What is a VPN?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A virtual private network (VPN) is a mechanism for creating a secure
connection between a computing device and a computer network, or
between two networks, using an insecure communication medium such as the
public Internet
&ndash; <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">Wikipedia</a></cite></p></blockquote>
<p>They provide the ability to <em><strong>connect to remote computers, securely</strong></em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Security and privacy are two distinct concepts.
<cite> Read more here: <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/en/basics/common-threats/#security-and-privacy">PrivacyGuides</a></cite></p></blockquote>
<p>But why do you care? By connecting to remote computers, you could
<em><strong>mask and tunnel</strong></em> all of your traffic through it. (VPNs are used differently in enterprise)</p>
<p>What do I mean by mask and tunnel?</p>
<ul>
<li>Mask
<ul>
<li>The source of all of your traffic now seems to be the VPN server. You forward all the relevant information to the server to make the connections for you. In more simple terms, now you start to pretend to be someone else over the internet, i.e. you start wearing a mask.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tunnel
<ul>
<li>A secure tunnel is established between you and the VPN server, via encryption, such that the ISP cannot know what you&rsquo;re trying to access.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="basic-vpn-usage">Basic VPN usage:</h3>
<p><img alt="Normal VPN query" loading="lazy" src="/posts/virtual-private-networks/normal-vpn-query.webp"></p>
<p>A VPN shifts your trust from your ISP to a VPN server. Therefore choosing a VPN service is extremely crucial in determing privacy returns. A bad service will just be worse for your privacy.</p>
