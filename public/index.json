[{"content":" Why Use Instagram? I feel that even though privacy is very important for me, with time i have noticed that you can utilize instagram in such a way that it does not violate your privacy rights and prove useful in certain cenarios.\nFor The New Ones Being on instagram allows you to have a way to connect with new people that you might exchange your instagram id\u0026rsquo;s with. It is way more convinient to exhcnage instagram handles than trying to convince them to come to signal, which not many people really use.\nKeeping Up Instagram allows you to stay and keep in touch with friends that are not currently on privacy respecting platforms, those who you have met recently, and those who dont find it worth the effort, for whatever reason, and like things in one place. Which is something I have grown to respect. It also allows you stay up-to date with the trends that are currently ongoing. I really hate it when there is some conversation going on and i dont seem to get the references they make.\nTo advocate No one is stopping you to use instagram as a tool to spread more word about safeguarding digital privacy.\nHow Can You Make It Bearable? Along with using instagram, come a lot of problems. Such as issues regarding privacy, wasting your time while scrolling, and there are also some ethical concerns that some talk about.\nPrivacy Settings Instagram has split the settings regarding your account into two places as of the time of writing this post.\nGeneric Settings Profile Picture: Go to Settings \u0026gt; Edit Profile Use a generic profile picture. Your profile picture is publicly available, and using your own photo makes you identifiable and shares it with Instagram.\nPrivate Account: Go to Settings \u0026gt; Account Privacy Turn your account private to prevent making information public.\nI suggest going through all of the settings to ensure everything is set up to your liking.\nAccounts Center Disconnect Future Activity: Go to Account Settings \u0026gt; Your Information and Permissions \u0026gt; Your Activity Off Meta Technologies \u0026gt; Manage Future Activity This will disconnect information that businesses and organizations send Meta about your interactions with them.\nAd Preferences: Go to Accounts Settings \u0026gt; Ad Preferences \u0026gt; Manage Info \u0026gt; Activity Information from Ad Partners Select “No, don’t make my ads more relevant by using this information” to use less of your information for making personalized ads.\nEnable E2EE (End-To-End-Encryption) Instagram has supported end-to-end encryption (E2EE) in their chats for a while now, allowing for more private and secure conversations. The legitimacy and effectiveness of this feature will be discussed in a future post.\nProductivity Tips To maximize your time on Instagram:\nFollow Valuable Accounts: Follow people and accounts that add value to your life. Avoid Mindless Scrolling: Be mindful of your usage to prevent wasting time. By following these tips, you can use Instagram in a way that aligns with your privacy values and lifestyle.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/thesillyscribbles/posts/how-why-insta/","summary":"\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\n\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"why-use-instagram\"\u003eWhy Use Instagram?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel that even though privacy is very important for me, with time i have noticed that you can utilize instagram in such a way that it does not violate your privacy rights and prove useful in certain cenarios.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"for-the-new-ones\"\u003eFor The New Ones\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing on instagram allows you to have a way to connect with new people that you might exchange your instagram id\u0026rsquo;s with.

But reddit makes all of this really hard by just providing a linear way of saving content without having any extra control whatsoever. After further research, I have found that we can use private subreddits as a way to save personal content.\nHow Creating a private subreddit can change how you save content on Reddit. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get you started:\nCreate a Private Subreddit: Start by making a new subreddit and setting it to private. This ensures that only you and selected members can access the curated content. Crosspost Useful Posts: Whenever you find a post worth saving, crosspost it to your private subreddit. This keeps all your favorite content in one place. Use Flairs for Tagging: Utilize flairs to categorize your posts. Flairs act like tags and help in organizing content by topic, theme, or any other criteria you prefer. Enhance with Titles and Descriptions: Add detailed titles and descriptions to your posts. This extra layer of information aids in finding specific content later. Why Reddit is a trove of information, but it lacks tools for organizing saved content efficiently. By creating a private subreddit and using flairs, titles, and descriptions, you can turn a chaotic collection of saved posts into a well-organized library. This method not only keeps your favorite content neatly stored but also makes retrieval easy and intuitive.\nNow you basically have your own personal corner of reddit, just for you. Saved the way you want it. I find it really powerful.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/thesillyscribbles/posts/reddit-curate/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently have been wanting to curate certain content, be it for design inspiration, or let\u0026rsquo;s just a outfit that I really like, or a life changing skincare tip that I must save for later.

While the intention behind this bill seems noble—establishing control over a wider range of broadcasting services and implementing censorship—the implications are far-reaching and concerning for press freedom, privacy, and creative expression.\nA Consolidated Regulatory Framework The proposed bill seeks to consolidate all broadcasting services, including digital platforms like social media, under a single regulatory framework. This move raises questions about the government\u0026rsquo;s intentions and potential control over what content is permitted in public discourse as we are well aware of the control established by the majority government in the past decade over journalistic independence and freedom. By expanding its reach to cover both traditional and digital mediums, the bill poses a significant threat to India\u0026rsquo;s digital journalism, which has played a crucial role in shaping public opinion and intellectual in the recent years, when the traditional forms of media were completely biased.\nThreats to Press Freedom The bill proposes strong content regulation through a separate committee responsible for regulating and censoring content on every service. This move raises concerns about the government\u0026rsquo;s control over what can be reported and how journalists are expected to conduct themselves when sharing news or opinions. Additionally, the requirement for individual journalists and creators to register and follow broadcasting rules when commenting on news is troubling, as it could lead to self-censorship and stifle independent voices.\nThe Dominance of Government The broadcasting advisory council in the proposed bill is dominated by government bureaucrats rather than independent voices. This move raises concerns about the potential for political influence over media content and the erosion of journalistic integrity. It also implies that the government will have a substantial role in shaping public discourse, which could lead to a suppression of dissenting views, highlights of which have very well been seen.\nPrivacy Concerns The requirement for broadcasting network operators to maintain detailed subscriber data, including personal information, raises privacy concerns. This move can potentially expose individuals\u0026rsquo; private information to unauthorized parties and create vulnerabilities for identity theft or surveillance. Furthermore, the collection and storage of such sensitive data could infringe upon citizens\u0026rsquo; rights to privacy.\nCall to action As this proposed bill gains momentum in India\u0026rsquo;s legislative process, it is essential that citizens, journalists, and media professionals take a stand against its potential dangers. Here are some steps you can take:\nContact your local representatives and express your concerns about the bill. Share your thoughts on social media using relevant hashtags such as #KillTheBill to raise awareness. Support organizations and individuals who are fighting against the bill such as IFF (Indian Freedom Foundation).

You forward all the relevant information to the server to make the connections for you. In more simple terms, now you start to pretend to be someone else over the internet, i.e. you start wearing a mask. Tunnel A secure tunnel is established between you and the VPN server, via encryption, such that the ISP cannot know what you\u0026rsquo;re trying to access.
