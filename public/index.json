But I would like to argue that proprietary software can only exploit your freedom to the extent that you allow it to. In fact, you can even use it to your advantage.\nFree Software and Freedom For those who aren’t familiar with free software, check out gnu.org\n“Free software” means software that respects users\u0026rsquo; freedom and community.\nThis definition highlights that freedom isn’t something a piece of software grants you—it’s something you already have. Free software exists to ensure that your inherent freedom isn’t undermined or exploited by the tools you use.\nProprietary Software With software becoming commercialized, the need to keep it secret increased. Proprietary software is designed primarily to generate profit, often at the expense of the kind of freedoms free software offers. Think about how Meta’s platforms keep you hooked with endless “Reels” and notifications—exploiting your natural dopamine response. Yet, even here, the key is that such exploitation is only as potent as your own digital habits allow it to be.\nThe Compromise What if we leverage proprietary services to our own good? We can choose to use these tools only when they work for us while supporting free alternatives in other cases. For example, you might use Instagram to keep in touch with people without oversharing or getting lost in endless scrolling. It’s about being deliberate: use proprietary services for their strengths but don’t let them dictate your digital life.\nFinal Thoughts Ultimately, the debate isn’t just about free versus proprietary software—it’s about how you, as the user, choose to interact with your tools. By taking charge of your digital habits, you can ensure that every piece of software works for you, not against you.\n","permalink":"https://blog.kushagraj.xyz/posts/tool-or-trap/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI believe often the conversation about software—especially when concerning privacy—is about free software and the freedom associated with it.

Yet keeping those moments safe seems to be a fading idea as everything becomes so digitally transient and hard to preserve.\nToday, I’m taking you on a journey I’ve been on myself: safeguarding the moments that mean the most—the story of our lives, our loved ones, and our identities. Because, honestly, isn’t that what life’s all about? I just want you to be able to lie in your 80s, looking at these preserved, disconnected moments that you once dismissed as trivial, slowly coming together into a narrative that makes you smile and cry at the same time.\nSo, shall we start?\nGet it Physical Digital may feel fleeting, but I believe that printing your memories is the only way they’ll truly last. In the coming weeks, I’m planning to pick and choose my best pictures and get them printed on acid-free paper. (I’m also linking to ente\u0026rsquo;s blog on physical photo archival, which covers everything you need to know about preserving physical photos.)\nRead ente\u0026rsquo;s blog here\nDigital Storage Now comes the inevitable digital part. Sure, if you have all your photos printed, that’s awesome—but given how many pictures we click these days, the cost and convenience of digital backups are too good to ignore. It makes sense to have multiple backups, so here are your options:\nM-Disk\nM-disks are these fancy disks made with non-organic matter that claim to last for centuries. We haven’t lived long enough to fully test that, but they’re considered the gold standard for professional archival. Just don’t rely on them as your only backup.\nHard Drives\nTraditional spinning hard drives can last up to 10 years. I’m currently using two LUKS-encrypted drives—each about 5 years old—to store all my photos. It’s not ideal, but it’s what I can afford right now. Just remember to read and write to your drives at least once a year to keep them happy.\nCloud\nThis one’s controversial. I’m personally not a fan of the cloud, but if you decide to use it, you can technically tar up your files (or use another compression method), encrypt them with GPG, and then upload to any cloud service. Just be sure to use a strong password. It might serve as a good backup in case all your other copies fail.\nFinal Thoughts Preserving your photos is more than just a technical task—it’s an act of love and rebellion against time. Whether you’re meticulously printing your favorite memories or setting up multiple digital backups, every step you take is a promise to your past and a gift to your future.\nSo, get out there and start your photo archival. Your memories deserve nothing less than a thoughtful home—both in print and in bits.\nKeep clicking, keep preserving, and above all, keep cherishing the moments that make you, you!\n","permalink":"https://blog.kushagraj.xyz/posts/photo-archival/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all have memories—and memories we desperately want to protect.

OpenStreetMap is an open database of geographic data (geo-data) that anyone can contribute to. Unlike maps controlled by profit-driven corporations, OSM is a purely community-driven project. Its mission is to create a comprehensive and freely accessible log of all geographic data on Earth.\nWhy Should You Care? Community Driven\nOSM is built by volunteers from all over the world, making it a shared resource owned by no single entity. This open model prevents corporate control over what data is added, modified, or prioritized. Maps controlled by private companies often introduce issues like biased data inclusion and reduced privacy. OSM stands as a fair and equitable alternative. It\u0026rsquo;s a Database\nAt its core, OSM is a database. This enables users to perform incredibly detailed and specialized tasks beyond what traditional maps offer. Whether it’s building navigation systems, analyzing urban infrastructure, or creating highly customized maps, OSM’s database unlocks limitless possibilities. Learn more about using OSM data. Why I Contribute For me, OpenStreetMap feels like a miniature digital version of Earth. It’s a recreation of our world, and contributing to it excites me. I see it as a way to make this virtual Earth as complete and accurate as possible.\nHere are more reasons why I love contributing:\nGranularity: OSM allows contributors to add incredibly minute details—things you’d never find on a corporate map. For instance, I’ve added over 50 shelters in Delhi to the map, which brings me a sense of pride and fulfillment. Beyond shelters, you can map basketball courts, football fields, gates, trees, and even park benches. The smallest contributions collectively make OSM an unparalleled resource.\nEquitable Access: Earth belongs to all of us. By contributing to OSM, I’m helping ensure that geographic data remains freely accessible to everyone, regardless of background or location. This open access empowers individuals and communities in ways commercial maps never could.\nExploring Local Regions: Contributing to OSM motivates me to explore local areas that are often overlooked or underrepresented. Mapping these regions not only helps the database but also gets me more involved in my locality.\nJoin the Movement If you’ve ever felt frustrated by the limitations of traditional maps or simply want to make a difference, OSM is an incredible platform to explore. It’s not just about mapping—it’s about contributing to a global, community-driven project that benefits everyone.\nStart small. Add a detail in your neighborhood, like a park or a missing road. Or go big and help map entire regions. Every contribution counts.\nReady to get started? Visit the OSM Editing Page and start mapping today.

Development containers are isolated environments that function like sandboxed operating systems. Essentially, they’re self-contained operating systems that can run independently or with limited interaction with your host operating system (e.g., Windows, Linux, or macOS).\nYou can think of them as neat little cargo boxes, not interfering with each other.\nWhy Do They Matter? Using development containers opens up a range of possibilities that make development more streamlined, flexible, and efficient. Here are some key benefits:\nPlatform-Specific Development: I can run Flutter development in a Debian-based container (since it’s officially supported) while keeping my host environment as Arch Linux.\nVersion Control: Containers allow me to work with specific versions of dependencies for a project without affecting or being affected by the versions on my host system.\nEnvironment Consistency: Sharing the exact development environment with friends or teammates ensures that everyone works with the same setup, reducing “it works on my machine” issues.\nTools for Managing Development Containers You have several options for managing development containers. Here are two popular ones:\nDistrobox (based on Podman):\nProvides tight integration with the host system. Ideal for creating lightweight, flexible environments. Docker:\nA more widely known solution with extensive community support. Excellent for creating highly isolated and reproducible environments. These tools are your gateways to managing containers effectively.\nHow to Create a Debian Distrobox Container If you want to create a Debian-based Distrobox container for Flutter development, follow these steps:\ndistrobox create flutter --image debian After running this command, the required images will be pulled, and necessary packages will be installed. Once complete, you’ll have your Distrobox container ready to use as a development environment. From here, you can export applications, install development tools, and much more.\nFinal Thoughts Development containers are a game-changer for maintaining a clean, flexible, and reproducible workflow. Whether you’re juggling multiple projects, collaborating with a team, or experimenting with new tools, containers help you stay organized and efficient.\nReferences Dev Containers Tutorial - Visual Studio Code Official Documentation - Docker Distrobox - GitHub ","permalink":"https://blog.kushagraj.xyz/posts/how-i-manage-dev-containers/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn this blog post, I’ll share how I manage my development containers, why they’re essential for my workflow, and how you can integrate them into yours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-are-development-containers\"\u003eWhat Are Development Containers?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevelopment containers are isolated environments that function like sandboxed operating systems.

I chose this topic while solving the \u0026ldquo;Two Sum\u0026rdquo; problem, which required the use of hashmaps to efficiently find a solution. In this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll cover hash functions, linked lists, and how they come together to form hashmaps.\nHashing Let’s start by understanding hashing. Hashing is a process of mapping variable-sized input data (like strings or numbers) to a fixed-size output. This mapping is carried out by a hashing function.\nHashing functions can produce outputs of different lengths. For example, a hash function that outputs 6 characters will always generate a string of exactly 6 characters.\nHowever, this process creates a challenge. Since there are infinitely many possible inputs but only a finite number of possible outputs, collisions can occur. A collision happens when two different inputs generate the same output. While collisions are inevitable in theory, modern hash functions like SHA256 are designed to minimize their occurrence, making them exceedingly rare in practice.\nHashing is widely used beyond hashmaps. Some common applications include digital signatures, public key cryptography, and more.\nLinked Lists Now that we understand how hashing works, let’s move on to linked lists, which are crucial in handling collisions in hashmaps.\nA linked list is a dynamic data structure that doesn\u0026rsquo;t store elements contiguously in memory. Instead, each element points to the next element, forming a chain-like structure.\nHashmaps Hashmaps combine hash functions and linked lists to create a data structure optimized for fast data retrieval. Here\u0026rsquo;s how it works:\nFirst, we use a hashing function to compute the hash of a given key (our input), and also store the value a associated with it. This hash is then used to determine the index in an array where the data is stored. We refer to these indices as buckets. If a collision occurs (i.e., two keys hash to the same bucket), the collided elements are stored as a linked list at that bucket.\nBy combining the quick lookup capabilities of hash functions with the flexibility of linked lists, hashmaps allow us to efficiently store and retrieve data, even when collisions occur.\nRelated https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/47809/why-havent-any-sha-256-collisions-been-found-yet https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-linked-lists-work/ ","permalink":"https://blog.kushagraj.xyz/posts/what-are-hashmaps/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"background\"\u003eBackground\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, we’ll discuss hashmaps—a fundamental data structure in computer science.

These are fundamental skills for any developer, regardless of the field you\u0026rsquo;re in, and mastering them can significantly sharpen your problem-solving abilities. Beyond that, DSA is also intellectually stimulating and—dare I say—fun, especially when you’re tackling challenges with a friend. Now seems like the perfect time to revisit these essential topics.\nSolving Problems In computer science, just like in life, there are often multiple ways to solve a single problem. Each solution comes with its own trade-offs—just like how different recipes for making a cake can require varying amounts of time, effort, and ingredients. Similarly, algorithms have different \u0026ldquo;costs\u0026rdquo; in terms of resources.\nWhen discussing algorithms, we typically focus on two major abstract resources: time and space. While these terms might seem straightforward, their impact on how we evaluate solutions requires a closer look. Let’s break them down.\nTime Complexity Time complexity is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm increases as the size of the input grows. It helps us understand how efficient an algorithm is, especially as we deal with larger data sets. Time complexity is usually expressed using Big O notation, which describes the worst-case scenario—how the algorithm performs when the input is as demanding as possible.\nFor example, if an algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), it means the execution time increases linearly with the input size n. So, if you double the input size, the runtime will also approximately double. Here’s a visual representation of different time complexities and how they compare:\nIn this diagram, you can see how different time complexities (e.g., O(1), O(n), O(n^2)) grow as the input size increases. The goal is to minimize the time complexity for more efficient algorithms.\nSpace Complexity Space complexity, on the other hand, measures how much memory an algorithm uses to solve a problem. This includes both the memory used by the input itself and any additional memory (auxiliary space) the algorithm requires during its execution.\nFor instance, if you’re sorting an array in place, your space complexity could be O(1) because you aren’t using any extra memory outside of the input. However, if the algorithm needs additional storage, such as an extra array for temporary data, the space complexity might increase to O(n).\nUnderstanding space complexity is just as important as time complexity because, in some cases, memory usage can be the limiting factor, especially when working with large datasets or resource-constrained environments.\nConclusion Mastering time and space complexity is crucial for writing efficient algorithms. By learning how to evaluate and optimize these factors, you can make better decisions when solving problems and choosing the right approach for the task at hand. In future posts, I’ll explore specific algorithms, their complexities, and how to apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.\nReferences Big O Cheat Sheet – Time Complexity Chart - freecodecamp Time Complexity - Wikipedia Space Complexity - Wikipedia ","permalink":"https://blog.kushagraj.xyz/posts/time-space-complexity/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"background\"\u003eBackground\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve recently decided to dive back into data structures and algorithms (DSA).

While the intention behind this bill seems noble—establishing control over a wider range of broadcasting services and implementing censorship—the implications are far-reaching and concerning for press freedom, privacy, and creative expression.\nA Consolidated Regulatory Framework The proposed bill seeks to consolidate all broadcasting services, including digital platforms like social media, under a single regulatory framework. This move raises questions about the government\u0026rsquo;s intentions and potential control over what content is permitted in public discourse as we are well aware of the control established by the majority government in the past decade over journalistic independence and freedom. By expanding its reach to cover both traditional and digital mediums, the bill poses a significant threat to India\u0026rsquo;s digital journalism, which has played a crucial role in shaping public opinion and intellectual in the recent years, when the traditional forms of media were completely biased.\nThreats to Press Freedom The bill proposes strong content regulation through a separate committee responsible for regulating and censoring content on every service. This move raises concerns about the government\u0026rsquo;s control over what can be reported and how journalists are expected to conduct themselves when sharing news or opinions. Additionally, the requirement for individual journalists and creators to register and follow broadcasting rules when commenting on news is troubling, as it could lead to self-censorship and stifle independent voices.\nThe Dominance of Government The broadcasting advisory council in the proposed bill is dominated by government bureaucrats rather than independent voices. This move raises concerns about the potential for political influence over media content and the erosion of journalistic integrity. It also implies that the government will have a substantial role in shaping public discourse, which could lead to a suppression of dissenting views, highlights of which have very well been seen.\nPrivacy Concerns The requirement for broadcasting network operators to maintain detailed subscriber data, including personal information, raises privacy concerns. This move can potentially expose individuals\u0026rsquo; private information to unauthorized parties and create vulnerabilities for identity theft or surveillance. Furthermore, the collection and storage of such sensitive data could infringe upon citizens\u0026rsquo; rights to privacy.\nCall to action As this proposed bill gains momentum in India\u0026rsquo;s legislative process, it is essential that citizens, journalists, and media professionals take a stand against its potential dangers. Here are some steps you can take:\nContact your local representatives and express your concerns about the bill.

A good UX appropriately solves the user problem and is accessible to all irrespective of their disabilities. Your dress can be as beautiful as you want it to be, but it cant\u0026rsquo; be functional if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have enough pockets, or keeps you warm when it\u0026rsquo;s cold.\nFact: UX is not limted digitally, it can encompass things like chairs, door locks and even clothes as i mentioned above.\n","permalink":"https://blog.kushagraj.xyz/posts/what-is-ui-ux/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWe live in the age of information, the age of data, yet seldom do we notice, care or appreciate it\u0026rsquo;s representation.

What the people need is choice. The ability to choose what we wish to share and what we wish to access, and a VPN puts that power in your hands.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s talk some tech.\nWhat is a VPN? A virtual private network (VPN) is a mechanism for creating a secure connection between a computing device and a computer network, or between two networks, using an insecure communication medium such as the public Internet \u0026ndash; Wikipedia\nThey provide the ability to connect to remote computers, securely.\nSecurity and privacy are two distinct concepts. Read more here: PrivacyGuides\nBut why do you care? By connecting to remote computers, you could mask and tunnel all of your traffic through it. (VPNs are used differently in enterprise)\nWhat do I mean by mask and tunnel?\nMask The source of all of your traffic now seems to be the VPN server. You forward all the relevant information to the server to make the connections for you. In more simple terms, now you start to pretend to be someone else over the internet, i.e. you start wearing a mask. Tunnel A secure tunnel is established between you and the VPN server, via encryption, such that the ISP cannot know what you\u0026rsquo;re trying to access. Basic VPN usage: A VPN shifts your trust from your ISP to a VPN server. Therefore choosing a VPN service is extremely crucial in determing privacy returns. A bad service will just be worse for your privacy.\n","permalink":"https://blog.kushagraj.xyz/posts/virtual-private-networks/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eVirtual Private Networks act as an important tool in the modern digital landscape empowering many to protect their privacy, and circumvent government imposed censorship.
