It\u0026rsquo;s representation is as powerful as the information itself, it can change how the person feels about it and how they will remember it.\nGood design, when it’s done well, becomes invisible. It’s only when it’s done poorly that we notice it - Jared Spool\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s UI? It stands for user interface and is the visual aspect of how information is represented, this includes fonts, colors, menus, buttons and what not, all meticulously chosen to set the tone. It\u0026rsquo;s like you dressing up for the appropriate occasion. You dress differently for a wedding, for a party, for a beach, and for sleeping. Similarly we represent information according to the context. For a more formal website, you\u0026rsquo;d use more formal fonts, and monochromatic colors, but for a club\u0026rsquo;s website, you may choose to get creative with how things look.\nWhat is UX? UX is a broader concept that stands for user experience. It\u0026rsquo;s a superset of UI, emphasizing the end-user experience aspect of design. UX designers ensures that the digital landscape is not just elegant but effortlessly functional through rigourous testing. A good UX appropriately solves the user problem and is accessible to all irrespective of their disabilities. Your dress can be as beautiful as you want it to be, but it cant\u0026rsquo; be functional if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have enough pockets, or keeps you warm when it\u0026rsquo;s cold.\nFact: UX is not limted digitally, it can encompass things like chairs, door locks and even clothes as i mentioned above.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/thesillyscribbles/posts/what-is-ui-ux/","summary":"We live in the age of information, the age of data, yet seldom do we notice, care or appreciate it\u0026rsquo;s representation.

What the people need is choice. The ability to choose what we wish to share and what we wish to access, and a VPN puts that power in your hands.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s talk some tech.\nWhat is a VPN? A virtual private network (VPN) is a mechanism for creating a secure connection between a computing device and a computer network, or between two networks, using an insecure communication medium such as the public Internet \u0026ndash; Wikipedia\nThey provide the ability to connect to remote computers, securely.\nSecurity and privacy are two distinct concepts. Read more here: PrivacyGuides\nBut why do you care? By connecting to remote computers, you could mask and tunnel all of your traffic through it. (VPNs are used differently in enterprise)\nWhat do I mean by mask and tunnel?\nMask The source of all of your traffic now seems to be the VPN server. You forward all the relevant information to the server to make the connections for you. In more simple terms, now you start to pretend to be someone else over the internet, i.e. you start wearing a mask. Tunnel A secure tunnel is established between you and the VPN server, via encryption, such that the ISP cannot know what you\u0026rsquo;re trying to access. Basic VPN usage: A VPN shifts your trust from your ISP to a VPN server. Therefore choosing a VPN service is extremely crucial in determing privacy returns. A bad service will just be worse for your privacy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/thesillyscribbles/posts/virtual-private-networks/","summary":"Virtual Private Networks act as an important tool in the modern digital landscape empowering many to protect their privacy, and circumvent government imposed censorship.
