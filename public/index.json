[{"content":"I recently have been wanting to curate certain content, be it for design inspiration, or let\u0026rsquo;s just a outfit that I really like, or a life changing skincare tip that I must save for later. But reddit makes all of this really hard by just providing a linear way of saving content without having any extra control whatsoever. After further research, I have found that we can use private subreddits as a way to save personal content.\nHow Creating a private subreddit can change how you save content on Reddit. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get you started:\nCreate a Private Subreddit: Start by making a new subreddit and setting it to private. This ensures that only you and selected members can access the curated content. Crosspost Useful Posts: Whenever you find a post worth saving, crosspost it to your private subreddit. This keeps all your favorite content in one place. Use Flairs for Tagging: Utilize flairs to categorize your posts. Flairs act like tags and help in organizing content by topic, theme, or any other criteria you prefer. Enhance with Titles and Descriptions: Add detailed titles and descriptions to your posts. This extra layer of information aids in finding specific content later. Why Reddit is a trove of information, but it lacks tools for organizing saved content efficiently. By creating a private subreddit and using flairs, titles, and descriptions, you can turn a chaotic collection of saved posts into a well-organized library. This method not only keeps your favorite content neatly stored but also makes retrieval easy and intuitive.\nNow you basically have your own personal corner of reddit, just for you. Saved the way you want it. I find it really powerful.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/thesillyscribbles/posts/reddit-curate/","summary":"I recently have been wanting to curate certain content, be it for design inspiration, or let\u0026rsquo;s just a outfit that I really like, or a life changing skincare tip that I must save for later.

While the intention behind this bill seems noble—establishing control over a wider range of broadcasting services and implementing censorship—the implications are far-reaching and concerning for press freedom, privacy, and creative expression.\nA Consolidated Regulatory Framework The proposed bill seeks to consolidate all broadcasting services, including digital platforms like social media, under a single regulatory framework. This move raises questions about the government\u0026rsquo;s intentions and potential control over what content is permitted in public discourse as we are well aware of the control established by the majority government in the past decade over journalistic independence and freedom. By expanding its reach to cover both traditional and digital mediums, the bill poses a significant threat to India\u0026rsquo;s digital journalism, which has played a crucial role in shaping public opinion and intellectual in the recent years, when the traditional forms of media were completely biased.\nThreats to Press Freedom The bill proposes strong content regulation through a separate committee responsible for regulating and censoring content on every service. This move raises concerns about the government\u0026rsquo;s control over what can be reported and how journalists are expected to conduct themselves when sharing news or opinions. Additionally, the requirement for individual journalists and creators to register and follow broadcasting rules when commenting on news is troubling, as it could lead to self-censorship and stifle independent voices.\nThe Dominance of Government The broadcasting advisory council in the proposed bill is dominated by government bureaucrats rather than independent voices. This move raises concerns about the potential for political influence over media content and the erosion of journalistic integrity. It also implies that the government will have a substantial role in shaping public discourse, which could lead to a suppression of dissenting views, highlights of which have very well been seen.\nPrivacy Concerns The requirement for broadcasting network operators to maintain detailed subscriber data, including personal information, raises privacy concerns. This move can potentially expose individuals\u0026rsquo; private information to unauthorized parties and create vulnerabilities for identity theft or surveillance. Furthermore, the collection and storage of such sensitive data could infringe upon citizens\u0026rsquo; rights to privacy.\nCall to action As this proposed bill gains momentum in India\u0026rsquo;s legislative process, it is essential that citizens, journalists, and media professionals take a stand against its potential dangers. Here are some steps you can take:\nContact your local representatives and express your concerns about the bill. Share your thoughts on social media using relevant hashtags such as #KillTheBill to raise awareness. Support organizations and individuals who are fighting against the bill such as IFF (Indian Freedom Foundation).

It\u0026rsquo;s representation is as powerful as the information itself, it can change how the person feels about it and how they will remember it.\nGood design, when it’s done well, becomes invisible. It’s only when it’s done poorly that we notice it - Jared Spool\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s UI? It stands for user interface and is the visual aspect of how information is represented, this includes fonts, colors, menus, buttons and what not, all meticulously chosen to set the tone. It\u0026rsquo;s like you dressing up for the appropriate occasion. You dress differently for a wedding, for a party, for a beach, and for sleeping. Similarly we represent information according to the context. For a more formal website, you\u0026rsquo;d use more formal fonts, and monochromatic colors, but for a club\u0026rsquo;s website, you may choose to get creative with how things look.\nWhat is UX? UX is a broader concept that stands for user experience. It\u0026rsquo;s a superset of UI, emphasizing the end-user experience aspect of design. UX designers ensures that the digital landscape is not just elegant but effortlessly functional through rigourous testing. A good UX appropriately solves the user problem and is accessible to all irrespective of their disabilities. Your dress can be as beautiful as you want it to be, but it cant\u0026rsquo; be functional if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have enough pockets, or keeps you warm when it\u0026rsquo;s cold.\nFact: UX is not limted digitally, it can encompass things like chairs, door locks and even clothes as i mentioned above.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/thesillyscribbles/posts/what-is-ui-ux/","summary":"We live in the age of information, the age of data, yet seldom do we notice, care or appreciate it\u0026rsquo;s representation.

What the people need is choice. The ability to choose what we wish to share and what we wish to access, and a VPN puts that power in your hands.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s talk some tech.\nWhat is a VPN? A virtual private network (VPN) is a mechanism for creating a secure connection between a computing device and a computer network, or between two networks, using an insecure communication medium such as the public Internet \u0026ndash; Wikipedia\nThey provide the ability to connect to remote computers, securely.\nSecurity and privacy are two distinct concepts. Read more here: PrivacyGuides\nBut why do you care? By connecting to remote computers, you could mask and tunnel all of your traffic through it. (VPNs are used differently in enterprise)\nWhat do I mean by mask and tunnel?\nMask The source of all of your traffic now seems to be the VPN server. You forward all the relevant information to the server to make the connections for you. In more simple terms, now you start to pretend to be someone else over the internet, i.e. you start wearing a mask. Tunnel A secure tunnel is established between you and the VPN server, via encryption, such that the ISP cannot know what you\u0026rsquo;re trying to access. Basic VPN usage: A VPN shifts your trust from your ISP to a VPN server. Therefore choosing a VPN service is extremely crucial in determing privacy returns. A bad service will just be worse for your privacy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/thesillyscribbles/posts/virtual-private-networks/","summary":"Virtual Private Networks act as an important tool in the modern digital landscape empowering many to protect their privacy, and circumvent government imposed censorship.
