            <description>Lately i had been dealing with an issue where my bluetooth would disable automatically upon login. I had done a lot of troubleshooting to realize that the issue was with me abruptly rebooting instead of rebooting via the gui.
Which would cause ~/.config/bluedevilglobalrc to look something like this:
[Adapters] 44:85:00:80:3C:BA_powered=false Solution: 1. Comment out the line to look something like this: [Adapters] #44:85:00:80:3C:BA_powered=false I have tested this and there does not seem to be any functionality issue whatsoever</description>
