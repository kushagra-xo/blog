      <description>PITX is a file format that I have envisioned to create in the coming months as a new way to store digital media, a way where images are stored with their context, with their story, i.e. text.
Inspiration Every image tells a story, yet so many of these stories are lost due to the lack of appropriate textual context. This gap inspired me to create PITX, a new file format designed to store images along with their stories, bringing us back to the exact moments we cherish.</description>

      <title>What Is UI/UX?</title>

      <description>We live in the age of information, the age of data, yet seldom do we notice, care or appreciate it&amp;rsquo;s representation. It&amp;rsquo;s representation is as powerful as the information itself, it can change how the person feels about it and how they will remember it.
Good design, when it’s done well, becomes invisible. It’s only when it’s done poorly that we notice it - Jared Spool
What&amp;rsquo;s UI? It stands for user interface and is the visual aspect of how information is represented, this includes fonts, colors, menus, buttons and what not, all meticulously chosen to set the tone.</description>

      <description>Virtual Private Networks act as an important tool in the modern digital landscape empowering many to protect their privacy, and circumvent government imposed censorship. What the people need is choice. The ability to choose what we wish to share and what we wish to access, and a VPN puts that power in your hands.
Let&amp;rsquo;s talk some tech.
What is a VPN? A virtual private network (VPN) is a mechanism for creating a secure connection between a computing device and a computer network, or between two networks, using an insecure communication medium such as the public Internet &amp;ndash; Wikipedia</description>

      <title>KDE Bluetooth Disabled on Login</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/thesillyscribbles/posts/kde-bluetooth-on-login/</link>

      <description>Lately i had been dealing with an issue where my bluetooth would disable automatically upon login. I had done a lot of troubleshooting to realize that the issue was with me abruptly rebooting instead of rebooting via the gui.
Which would cause ~/.config/bluedevilglobalrc to look something like this:
[Adapters] 44:85:00:80:3C:BA_powered=false Solution: 1. Comment out the line to look something like this: [Adapters] #44:85:00:80:3C:BA_powered=false I have tested this and there does not seem to be any functionality issue whatsoever</description>
